 Quick notes on writing a tutorial
=====================

New tutorials should be prepared in Markdown rather than HTML if possible. 

* Create a new directory in MDtutorials (./MDtutorials/<newtutorial>) for the
   tutorial (or combine into an existing directory), 

* Create file for the tutoral as ./MDtutorials/<newtutorial>/<tutorialfile>.md 
  <newtutorial> and <tutorialfile> will commonly be the same, but need not be so.

  The final tutorial will be placed in
  https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/<newtutorial>/<tutorialfile>.html

* Images for the tutorial should be placed in subdirectory imgs, ./MDtutorials/<newtutorial>/imgs

* data files needed for the tutorial should be placed in subdirectory ./MDtutorials/<newtutorial>/data


The tutorial .md file should start with:

    	         ---
		 title: "Tutorial: Changing the GSAS-II Font Size"
		 ---
		 <!--- Don't change the HTML version of this file; edit the .md version -->

* Sections should be labeled with

  	   ## Intro

   and, subsections with

   	   ### Subsection title

  Sections and subsections will be numbered; subsubsections (etc.) will not be numbered.
  Place a blank line before and after the section label


* For links, use: [displayed text](http://url)

* For figures, which will be sized at 400px max and will be placed at the right margin, use:

      	       ![caption text](imgs/<filename>.png)

   Place a blank line before and after the figure


* If needed, where a figure will be sized and placed manually, use HTML directly:

     	     <img src="./imgs/nuc_struct.png" alt="nuclear structure" style="width:500px;">


* Equations can be specified with MathJax:

  	    	 Er${}_2$Ge${}_2$O${}_7$
		 P$4_1 2_1 2$

* Tables can be created using pipe characters

  	 |  `FontSize_incr`  | Example |
	 | :---: | ------------------------------------- | 
	 | 0 | ![Example of GSAS-II GUI with the default font size (font=0)](imgs/font0.png) |
	 | 3 | ![Example of GSAS-II GUI with the font increased by 3 units (font=3)](imgs/font3.png) |

   See markdown docs for other mechanisms to create tables

* To provide a link to a location within the tutorial, define an anchor at the location to be referenced

     	     <a name=myanchor></a>

   then the link to to this will be

   	    here is some text [with a link](#myanchor) provided 


* End the document with a table with the date and author(s):

      	  ----
	  | | 
	  | ---: |
	  | Brian Toby |
	  | January 10, 2025 |

* When the tutorial is complete, update GSASII/tutorialIndex.py to include the new tutorial
