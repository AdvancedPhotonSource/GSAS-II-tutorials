====================================
 Welcome to the GSAS-II home page
====================================

GSAS-II is a unique and comprehensive open source Python project for determination of crystal structures and diffraction-based materials characterization for crystalline solids on all scales, from perovskites through proteins, using both powder and single-crystal diffraction and with both x-ray and neutron probes. Refinements can combine measurements from laboratory and synchrotron x-rays, as well as constant wavelength or time-of-flight neutron sources. It provides structure solution and refinement, as well as extensive visualization capabilities.

GSAS-II is made available for free use (`see license <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/master/LICENSE>`_) with open access to ​the `source code <https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II>`_.

We add new features to GSAS-II quite frequently, so we may break things from time to time :strike:`(see bug reporting, below)`. Be sure to use the Help-->Update capability frequently to stay abreast of new features and fixes as they are added and please make sure to use the latest version before reporting a bug to us.
