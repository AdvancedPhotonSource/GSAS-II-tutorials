======================= 
Installation overview
=======================

Running GSAS-II requires a number of coordinated installation steps and there are many different ways this can be accomplished. One needs not only the necessary Python source code for GSAS-II, but a Python interpreter that includes a number of "add-on" Python packages for additonal capabilities. This much match the computer where the software will be run. Further, GSAS-II requires that a small amount of its code be compiled, typically for speed and this must be matched both the computer OS and to the Python version. Here I outline different a few different approaches.

GSAS2FULL installer
=======================

Most users of GSAS-II are seeking a simple way to install and run the software and can live with the idea that they may have duplicated Python installations (several hundreds of MB each) on their computer. The GSAS2FULL self-installer provides that and can be found `here <https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-buildtools/releases/latest>`_. Brief instructions follow:

Windows
-----------

For Windows download file and run file  https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-buildtools/releases/download/v1.0.1/gsas2full-Latest-Windows-x86_64.exe.
You will have a choice for where to install the software (the default is usually OK, but something like ``c:\software`` might be better, if your computer security allows that.)

More complete installation instructions `are here <install-g2f-win.html>`_.

MacOS and Linux
--------------------

For MacOS and Linux use a command such as:: 

  g2="https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-buildtools/releases/download/v1.0.1/gsas2full-Latest-<platform>"
  curl "$g2" > /tmp/g2.sh; bash /tmp/g2.sh -b -p <install-loc>

where:

 * <platform> is replaced by ``Linux-x86_64.sh`` for Linux, ``MacOSX-arm64.sh`` for MacOS with "Apple Silicon"  (M1, etc.) processors and ``MacOSX-x86_64.sh`` is for older Intel-based machines. Note that the ``MacOSX-x86_64.sh`` installer will run on "Apple Silicon" processors, but significantly more slowly. 
 * <install-loc> is where you want to install the software. (Use of ``~/g2full`` (a subdirectory named ``g2full`` in your home directory is a good choice.) After installation is complete, you may be asked if you want to place a shortcut for GSAS-II into the MacOS dock.

More complete installation instructions are provided for [TBD MacOS] and [TBD Linux].


GSAS2PKG Conda Package
=======================

Users who work extensively with Python and use the conda Python installer may prefer to utilize their existing conda installation to obtain GSAS-II along with the Python configuration that GSAS-II prefers. This can be done with this command (on all platforms)::

  conda create -n GSASII briantoby::gsas2pkg  -c conda-forge

This creates a conda virtual environment named ``GSASII`` (this can be changed) for use by GSAS-II. While it is also possible to install GSAS-II into the conda base environment, this is not recommended as it can create conflicts between Python and package versions needed by GSAS-II and those required by other packages.

Using a system-supplied Python
=================================

A small number of users or sites prefer to use Python distributions supplied via other routes (such as Debian packages, or using `PyPi <https://pypi.org/ PyPI>`_, etc). It is the user's responsibility to configure Python (at a minimum, GUI use requires wxPython, matplotlib,
PyOpenGL, NumPy and SciPy while for scripting use, only NumPy and SciPy are required) but a number of other optional packages needed for
full functionality, `as discussed here <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packages.html#gui-requirements>`_.
If versions other than those recommended are selected (Python=3.11 and NumPy=1.26), you will likely need to either locate older binaries and install them manually or run the compilation yourself.

A simple way to install GSAS-II with a supplied Python environment is to use these commands (on all platforms)::

  cd ~/G2
  curl -L -O https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-buildtools/raw/main/install/gitstrap.py
  python gitstrap.py

This will place the install script in directory ``~/G2`` (which you may wish to change) and will place all GSAS-II files in subdirectory ``~/G2/GSAS-II``

For GSAS-II Software Developers
=================================

While all of the above approaches will clone a copy of the GSAS-II repository from GitHub, software developers will likely wish to clone the repo themselves from
``git@github.com:AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II.git`` or ``https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II.git``.

If the repo is cloned at ``~/myProjects/myGSASII`` then the local copy of GSAS-II can be 
run as a GUI using::

  python ~/myProjects/myGSASII/GSASII/GSASII.py

Installation scripts used inside the above-listed approaches can still be used for GitHub repo installation. See discussion of makeMacApp.py, makeLinux.py and makeBat.py (for MacOS, Linux and Windows, respectively) in the `Developer's Documentation <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GSASIIscripts.html#gsas-ii-misc-scripts>`_.
Also, to simplify use of your local clone of the GSAS-II repo when scripting GSAS-II, see this `note on scripting shortcuts
<https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GSASIIscriptable.html#shortcut-for-scripting-access>`_. 

Older methods
=================================

Previously GSAS-II was provided via an Advanced Photon Source-maintained subversion (svn) server, with differing installation processes. While the installers for those processes are still available. Also, updates will be provided for those past svn installations for the immediate future. However, it is encouraged that users reinstall GSAS-II via one of the above methods. When svn updates will be phased out, GSAS-II will provide warning messages.
