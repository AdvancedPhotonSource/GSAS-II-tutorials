# GSAS-II Web Content

## Description
This repository contains the GSAS-II web content, which includes installation information for users as well as tutorials that demonstrate how different functionality
in GSAS-II works. 

## URLs
* The GSAS-II home page [is here](https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/index.html)

* The tutorials are usually accessed from the Help->Tutorials
menu in the GSAS-II program (this will ease downloading the files needed to
run the tutorials), but tutorials can also be accessed from this repository via [from this link](https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/tutorials.html)

## Repo Contents
Each tutorial is placed here in its own subdirectory. In that subdirectory, there will be a web page for that tutorial (extension .html or .htm) and two additional subdirectories, one named `data`, with the input file(s) needed for that tutorial and another with a name generated from the web page file name that contains images for the web page. 

In addition there are a few special directories: 

### docs
The docs directory contains documentation for externally generated codes, such as
DIFFaX, NIST*LATTICE and PDFfit2.

### scripts
The scripts directory contains a script (makeGitTutorial.py) used to build the web page referenced above.
