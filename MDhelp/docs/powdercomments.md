#  PWDR **Comments** subdata tree item (Powder Diffraction)

This window shows whatever comment lines (usually preceded by “#”, but this depends on the data format) found when the powder data file was read by GSAS-II. If you are lucky, there will be useful information here (e.g. sample name, date collected, wavelength used, etc.). If not, this window will be blank. The text is read-only. Nothing is plotted and there are no menu commands for this tree item.
