# *Draw Options*

<H3 style="color:blue;font-size:1.1em">What can I do here?</H3>

The Draw Options window provides access to a number of items that control how the structure is displayed. If a map is available (Fourier/charge flipping), one can display a 10Åx10Å contoured slice centered at the viewpoint. Contouring done as lines, colors or lines & colors combined. 3-D contouring is also available as green (red for negative density) map grid points. One can also draw individual or stack of hkl planes across unit cell.

A drawing that shows the atoms of the crystal structure is generated. The way that the structure is displayed is determined according to the controls in this page as well as the atoms selected and their settings on the [Draw Atoms](./phasedrawatoms.md) page.

Use of the mouse buttons and key presses when viewing a crystal structure changes the view of the structure; this is [described on the Atoms tab](./phaseatoms.md#Phase-mouse-plotopts).
