# GSAS-II Tutorials
<a name="Tutorial"></a>

The best way to learn about how different sections of GSAS-II is used
is to work through some of the tutorials. The best way to access the
tutorials is through the **Help/Tutorials** menu command, because once a tutorial
has been selected, this will both open the tutorial instructions in a web browser and will 
download any input files needed to run the tutorial. 
It is also possible to access the tutorials via a [separate web
page](https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/tutorials.html). 

Each tutorial demonstrates a different aspect of GSAS-II; when significant new
capabilities are added to GSAS-II it is common to create a new
tutorial. Note that 
it is unlikely that any one person will use all the features of
GSAS-II, so it is not necessary to run through all of them. New users are
suggested to look at some of the introductory tutorials and then pick
more advanced topics as needs arise.
