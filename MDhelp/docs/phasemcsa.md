# **MC/SA** phase tab

This tab displays Monte Carlo/Simulated Annealing model parameters and results. Each rigid body is described by a location (fractional x,y,z) and a quaternion description for the orientation (rotation angle & 3D vector) along with possible bond torsion angles on side chains. Each parameter has a defined range. The MC/SA controls on the General tab further limit the MC/SA run. Selection of a result shows a drawing of the structure with unit cell contents for visualization.

<H3 style="color:blue;font-size:1.1em">What can I do here?</H3>

1. Modify the preferred orientation model (currently not operational)
2. **MC/SA** Menu –
    * **Add atom** – add an isolated atom to the MC/SA model
    * **Add rigid body** – add a previously defined rigid body, which may have adjustable internal torsion angles.
    * **Clear rigid bodies** – removes rigid bodies from the MC/SA model
    * **Clear results** – clears table of MC/SA results from a previous set of MC/SA trials.
