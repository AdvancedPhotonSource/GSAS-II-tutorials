# **Dysnomia** phase tab

This is displayed if the **Use Dysnomia** box in the General tab is checked. [Dysnomia](https://doi.org/10.1017/S088571561300002X) is a maximum entropy method for improving Fourier density maps. The Dysnomia tab provides access to controls used in its operation.

<H3 style="color:blue;font-size:1.1em">What can I do here?</H3>

* **Operations** menu –
    * **Load from Dysnomia file** – as previously saved set of controls.
    * **Save Dysnomia file** – saves data needed to run Dysnomia
    * **Run Dysnomia** – execute the routine from GSAS-II (not a separate console). Replaces existing map with one improved by maximum entropy.
