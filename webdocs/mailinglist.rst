======================= 
Mailing List
=======================

We provide a mailing list for GSAS-II users to ask questions and more importantly, **so that we can reach users with news about GSAS-II**. Please do subscribe. The level of traffic on this list is pretty low, perhaps a few e-mails a month; Bob and I usually reply to directly to the sender to further reduce this traffic, unless the answer will be valuable to many people.
You can also search the `archives of the mailing list <​http://www.mail-archive.com/gsas-ii@mailman.aps.anl.gov/>`_.

Subscribing
-------------------
To subscribe, use
`​this link <https://mailman.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/GSAS-II>`_
or send an e-mail to `GSAS-II-request@mailman.aps.anl.gov  <GSAS-II-request@mailman.aps.anl.gov?subject=subscribe>`_.
Set the subject as "Subscribe" (or "Subscribe <password>" where <password> is your preference for a mailing list login password). You can also use "Help" as the subject to get a list of options 

Using the list
---------------------
You must subscribe with the address you use to send messages. Send questions or problems, but do not attach large files. The mailing list is not a good way to report bugs, since you will need to provide files needed to reproduce the bug. See `reporting bugs <bug.html>`_ for how to report bugs. That is also the best place to request new features.
