======================= 
Mailing List
=======================

We provide a mailing list for GSAS-II users to ask questions and more
importantly, **so that we can reach users with news about
GSAS-II**. Please do subscribe.
The level of traffic on this list is
pretty low (typically 30-60 e-mails/year); Bob and I usually reply to
directly to senders, unless the
answer will be valuable to many people. There is a searchable
`mailing list archive <https://mail-archive.com/gsas-ii@aps.anl.gov/>`_ (messages
prior to 2018 are
`here <http://www.mail-archive.com/gsas-ii@mailman.aps.anl.gov/>`_. 
There is also `an archive by the APS here
<https://mailman.aps.anl.gov/pipermail/gsas-ii/>`_, which allows mass
downloading of messages, but not searching.

`Bug reports <bug.html>`_ can be posted on this list, but we would greatly prefer
them posted on the
`GitHub Issues Tracker
<https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/issues>`_, but please 
`see notes on bug reporting <bug.html>`_ before posting.

Subscribing
-------------------
To subscribe, use
`this link <https://mailman.aps.anl.gov/mailman/listinfo/GSAS-II>`_
or send an e-mail to `GSAS-II-request@mailman.aps.anl.gov  <GSAS-II-request@mailman.aps.anl.gov?subject=subscribe>`_.
Set the subject as "Subscribe" (or "Subscribe <password>" where <password> is your preference for a mailing list login password). You can also use "Help" as the subject to get a list of options 

Using the list
---------------------
You must subscribe with the address you use to send messages. Send questions or problems, but do not attach large files. The mailing list is not a good way to report bugs, since you will need to provide files needed to reproduce the bug. See `reporting bugs <bug.html>`_ for how to report bugs. That is also the best place to request new features.
