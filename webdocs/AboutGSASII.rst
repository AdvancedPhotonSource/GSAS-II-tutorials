GSAS-II Citations
====================================

.. index:: Impact

The GSAS-II usage statistics must be considered in the context of the software that it replaced, GSAS/EXPGUI. It is difficult to catalog citations to GSAS, since it was
only published as a Los Alamos document report starting in 1985. However, EXPGUI, a graphical user interface to GSAS, was published and captures a large fraction of the GSAS user base. While GSAS-II was started as a project in ~2008, it was far from complete until around 2013 when first published:

     Toby, B. H., & Von Dreele, R. B. (2013). "GSAS-II: the genesis of a modern open-source all purpose crystallography software package". *Journal of Applied Crystallography*, **46**\(2), 544-549. `doi: 10.1107/S0021889813003531 <https://doi.org/10.1107/S0021889813003531>`_

Citations to this paper and the 2001 paper by B.H. Toby are tracked by the Web of Science and are our best way to track use of GSAS/EXPGUI and GSAS-II. Google Scholar citation rates are significantly higher, but their accuracy is unknown.      
While GSAS-II has been recommended as a replacement for GSAS/EXPGUI since ~2015, when GSAS-II incorporated pretty much all of the GSAS/EXPGUI capabilities judged still relevant, but for quite a few years after that, both EXPGUI and GSAS-II usage continued to grow, as shown in the citation rate plot below:

Only in the past few years has EXPGUI use started to fall. GSAS-II use continues to grow and at a rate considerably higher than the fall-off in EXPGUI use. 
           
GSAS-II Code Statistics
====================================

.. index:: Code statistics

As of October 2025, GSAS-II codebase contains:

  * 170,000 lines of Python code, of which 65,000 are used for the GUI.
  * 6,000 lines of Fortran code
  * 450 lines of C code

  Some of the compiled code (Fortran and C) provides computational kernels for that would be too slow if completed in Python. The majority of the Fortran code is a group theory analysis routine developed by Allen Larson to derive symmetry from Hermann-Mauguin space group symbols (short or long and including non-standard settings) developed for the NRCVAX program. This code was also used in GSAS, but has been updated to correct for errors. 

The documentation material consists of:
 
  * 14,000 words of web documentation
  * 50,000 words of context-specific help (~100 pages formatted)
  * 62 tutorials (140,000 lines of HTML and 500 words of MarkDown)
  * ~450 pages (as .pdf) of code documentation, generated by Sphinx from the Python source code

  
Vendored (externally produced, but distributed with GSAS-II) utilities included are composed of:

  * 4,000 lines of Python code
  * 10,000 lines of Fortran code
  * 100 lines of Cython
