GSAS-II Home Page
====================================

.. tip::

   A new section in the GSAS-II web documentation,
   `Announcements in "GitHub Discussions" <https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/discussions/categories/announcements>`_
   is now in use as a source of information on new capabilities added to
   GSAS-II. 

Welcome to the home page for GSAS-II, a unique and comprehensive open
source Python project for determination of crystal structures and
diffraction-based materials characterization for crystalline solids on
all scales, from perovskites through proteins, using both powder and
single-crystal diffraction and with both x-ray and neutron
probes. Refinements can combine measurements from laboratory and
synchrotron x-rays, as well as constant wavelength or time-of-flight
neutron sources. It provides structure solution and refinement, as
well as extensive visualization capabilities.

GSAS-II is made available for free use (`see license <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/master/LICENSE>`_) with open access to the `source code <https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II>`_.  

Also, please do sign up for the GSAS-II mailing list `see below <mailinglist.html>`_.
We add new features to GSAS-II quite frequently, so we may break
things from time to time (`see bug reporting <bug.html>`_). Be
sure to use the ``Help-->Update`` capability frequently to stay abreast of
new features and fixes as they are added and please make sure to use
the latest version before reporting a bug to us, but *please* do report
bugs.

Customizing GSAS-II
====================================

There are many options within GSAS-II that allow you to tailor aspects
of the program to operate differently. These are described
here. Options are available to change how
powder diffraction refinement results are plotted or change defaults
used in different parts of the program, for example.

Help: GSAS-II will not start
====================================

If there is a bug in GSAS-II, check for updates (using the Help/Update
menu command) and if the bug is present in the latest version, please
report it (see section above on reporting bugs).
Should GSAS-II fail to start after an update, then there are alternate
ways to update GSAS-II, as discussed below.
