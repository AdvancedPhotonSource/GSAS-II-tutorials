.. index:: GSAS-II tutorials

Tutorials
-----------------------

The primary way to learn about how to use GSAS-II is provided via ~50
topical tutorials that explore how to use different aspects of the program. 
Use ones that relate to your work is a strongly-encouraged way to start with GSAS-II or expand to a area. Tutorials are
best accessed from within the GSAS-II GUI (in the Help menu), but can also be `found here <https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/tutorials.html>`_.
Some older tutorials have video copies, so you can see the computer screen as the tutorial is being run.

.. index:: GSAS-II help pages

Help pages
-----------------------

The GSAS-II GUI provides context-based help via web files that are
distributed with the program, as well as can be `viewed here
<help/index.html>`_. These help pages are not complete for all
sections of the code,
but do provide at least some information on how every section of the program
works. The help information can also be viewed as a PDF document
`(Help as PDF)
<https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/docs/GSASII-help.pdf>`_.

Note that the help documentation was recently reformatted and updated
as MarkDown (simple text) input files found
in GitHub in the MDhelp directory of the
AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-tutorials repo (https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II-tutorials/tree/main/MDhelp).
Comments, corrections, additions and issue reports on Help content are most welcome. 

.. index:: Source code documentation

Developer's Documentation
----------------------------

450+ pages of code documentation generated from comments in the code
and RestructuredText documentation files are found on the `"Read The
Docs" web site <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io>`_. The documentation
can also be downloaded as a
PDF document `(Code Manual as PDF) <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_
or as
an electronic book `(Code Manual as e-book
<https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/epub/>`_, Epub format). 
Regardless of the format, this provides very useful documentation for
code developers, for people interested in creating GSAS-II scripts, or
incorporating GSAS-II capabilities into their software, or for those
curious about how GSAS-II functions.

Note that we welcome cooperation from people interested in developing or extending GSAS-II. The code is open source and we are happy to review submitted code or consider collaborations. Code developers should start with this Developer's Documentation.

Scripting Documentation
----------------------------

The documentation on scripting GSAS-II is contained in the Developer's
Documentation described immediately above, but an
`abridged version of the web site
<https://gsas-ii-scripting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ with 
only sections relevant to scripting is also available. This abridged
version can also be downloaded as a PDF document `(Scripting Manual as PDF) 
<https://gsas-ii-scripting.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_ or as
an electronic book `(Scripting Manual as e-book
<https://gsas-ii-scripting.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/epub/>`_,  Epub
format). 

News
----------------------------
GSAS-II is not a "finished product" in that we are constantly 
correcting bugs, adding new features and improving the science.
(Alas, sometimes
creating new bugs in that process.) At the same time, the computing
environment that GSAS-II runs in also changes, so code that runs fine
now may not run in a new version of an operating system or when Python
or a Python package is updated, so even standing still sometimes requires code
changes.

News on changes to GSAS-II, new features, etc. is
placed in the
`Announcements section of the GitHub Discussion
pages <https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/discussions/categories/announcements>`_.
This will be useful reading for people who work with GSAS-II frequently. 
One can also track the minutiae of changes made to GSAS-II from
`GitHub's log of commits <https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II/commits/main/>`_,
but since many commits may be used for a single bug-fix or new
feature, this can be hard to follow. 

Crystallography/Powder Diffraction Intro
-----------------------------------------------

For background material on powder diffraction crystallography, see the links
on our 
`Powder Diffraction Crystallography Educational Materials page <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Education/Powder-Diffraction-Educational-Materials>`_,
in addition to the very considerable amount of material found on other sites.
