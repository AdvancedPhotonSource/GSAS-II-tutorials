 Available Documentation for GSAS-II
====================================

Tutorials
-----------------------

The primary way to learn about how to use GSAS-II is provided via ~50
topical tutorials that explore how to use different aspects of the program. 
Use ones that relate to your work is a strongly-encouraged way to start with GSAS-II or expand to a area. Tutorials are
best accessed from within the GSAS-II GUI (in the Help menu), but can also be `found here <https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/tutorials.html>`_.
Some older tutorials have video copies, so you can see the computer screen as the tutorial is being run.

Help pages
-----------------------

The GSAS-II GUI provides context-based help via several web files that are
distributed with the program, as well as can be `viewed here
<help/gsasII-index.html>`_. These help pages are not always complete,
but do provide information on how different sections of the program
work.  

Developer's Documentation
----------------------------

400+ pages of code documentation generated from comments in the code and RestructuredText documentation files are found on a ​"Read The Docs" `web site <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io>`_. This provides documentation for code developers, for people interested in command-line access to GSAS-II or for the curious.

Note that we welcome cooperation from people interested in developing or extending GSAS-II. The code is open source and we are happy to review submitted code or consider collaborations. Code developers should start with this Developer's Documentation.

Crystallography/Powder Diffraction Intro
-----------------------------------------------

For background material on powder diffraction crystallography, see the links
on our ​
`Powder Diffraction Crystallography Educational Materials page <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Education/Powder-Diffraction-Educational-Materials>`_,
in addition to the very considerable amount of material found on other sites.
