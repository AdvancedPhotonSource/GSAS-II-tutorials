.. index:: GSAS-II tutorials

Tutorials
-----------------------

The primary way to learn about how to use GSAS-II is provided via ~50
topical tutorials that explore how to use different aspects of the program. 
Use ones that relate to your work is a strongly-encouraged way to start with GSAS-II or expand to a area. Tutorials are
best accessed from within the GSAS-II GUI (in the Help menu), but can also be `found here <https://advancedphotonsource.github.io/GSAS-II-tutorials/tutorials.html>`_.
Some older tutorials have video copies, so you can see the computer screen as the tutorial is being run.

.. index:: GSAS-II help pages

Help pages
-----------------------

The GSAS-II GUI provides context-based help via several web files that are
distributed with the program, as well as can be `viewed here
<help/gsasII-index.html>`_. These help pages are not always complete,
but do provide information on how different sections of the program
work.  

.. index:: Source code documentation

Developer's Documentation
----------------------------

450+ pages of code documentation generated from comments in the code
and RestructuredText documentation files are found on the `"Read The
Docs" web site <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io>`_. The documentation
can also be downloaded as a
`PDF document <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_
or as
`an electronic book <https://gsas-ii.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/epub/>`_
(Epub format). 
Regardless of the format, this provides very useful documentation for
code developers, for people interested in creating GSAS-II scripts, or
incorporating GSAS-II capabilities into their software, or for those
curious about how GSAS-II functions.

Note that we welcome cooperation from people interested in developing or extending GSAS-II. The code is open source and we are happy to review submitted code or consider collaborations. Code developers should start with this Developer's Documentation.

Scripting Documentation
----------------------------

The documentation on scripting GSAS-II is contained in the Developer's
Documentation described immediately above, but an
`abridged version of the web site
<https://gsas-ii-scripting.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ with 
only sections relevant to scripting is also available. This abridged
version can also be downloaded as a `PDF document
<https://gsas-ii-scripting.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/pdf/>`_ or as
`an electronic book
<https://gsas-ii-scripting.readthedocs.io/_/downloads/en/latest/epub/>`_  (Epub
format). 


Crystallography/Powder Diffraction Intro

For background material on powder diffraction crystallography, see the links
on our 
`Powder Diffraction Crystallography Educational Materials page <https://www.aps.anl.gov/Education/Powder-Diffraction-Educational-Materials>`_,
in addition to the very considerable amount of material found on other sites.
