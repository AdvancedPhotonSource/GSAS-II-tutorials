======================================
Documentation for GSAS-II Developers
======================================

Note the `documentation web page <documentation.html>`_, as the
"Developer's Documentation" document, available in several formats, is
of very significant value for code development.  

If you use any of the self-installer options (gsas2full, gsas2pkg or gitstrap.py), GSAS-II will be installed using https from https://github.com/AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II.git. This is fine for downloading, but to be able to write to the repository, you will probably need to switch to using ssh,
the command for this is::

    git remote set-url origin git@github.com:AdvancedPhotonSource/GSAS-II.git
